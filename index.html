    <h2 id="top">Education History</h2><br>
      <p>My name is Vinny Shipley I was born and raised in Everett, Washington. After completing High School I attended Western Washington University, and studied in the English Literature department for four years. After four years I took a break from school to focus on my professional career as a bartender. Now I find myself in school again, this time pursuing a much more financially viable career path.</p><br>

    <h2>Job Experience</h2><br>
      <p>I started off as a host at a brewery in Bellingham when I was 19, and quickly fell in love with the industry. From hosting I waited until I was 21, and then I began bartending. This is where the rubber really met the road for me professionally. I found bartending to be extremely rewarding for a long time. The fast-paced nature of the beast was really appealing, and still is to me to some extent. Now though, I find myself seeking a job that is more mentally engaging, as well as financially viable.</p><br>

    <h2>Personal Goals</h2><br>
      <p>Personally I would like to be placed in a good-paying tech job in a years time, along with health insurance and (fingers very much crossed) a 401k. I would also like to maintain the connections I make along my codefellows journey, as everyone I've come into contact with has been nothing but absolutely pleasant.</p>
